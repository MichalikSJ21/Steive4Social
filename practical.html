    <h1>Practical Actions</h1>
    <p>
        I believe that broad campaign promises often are left unfulfilled by people who run for student office.
        That is why I want to promise a few VERY practical things I know that are wanted and can be accomplished, while
        also stating general principles that will govern how I go about being your Social Affairs Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
        -I plan on suggesting and implementing a sort of campus events calendar to be posted in an online spot (likely myGCC or 
        the SGA Instagram account) so that everyone can know exactly when campus events happen. 
    </p>
    <p>
        -I promise to be available to the student body at all momemnts thoughout my SGA tenure. I will have no problem talking to 
        students about their suggestions, comments, or concerns with SGA. I see myself as a sort of extension of the desires of 
        the student body, always ready to here what is needed as a campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        -On a more broad level, I plan on working to make this campus as fun as a place as can possible be. Whether that be through the creation
        of new events, the continuation of already great events, or potentially cutting old events in favor of the new, as your Social Affairs Senator, I
        would work to make this place the most fun it could possibly be. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        -Finally, I promise to be guided by my faith in Jesus Christ throughout my tenure. God's word is the ultimate guide
        to my life, so I don't see why SGA would be an exception to that.
