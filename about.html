    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hey guys my name is Stevie Michalik. I'm the guy who looks like Tom Holland who you'll probably find sitting with my girlfriend
        at one of the double tables in STEM during the afternoon (best place to study on campus for the record). I am a double major (Data 
        Science and Business Analysis) from just about an hour south-west of here, Beaver Falls to be exact. 
    </p>

        I went to a small Christian high school called Beaver County Christian School for my entire schooling before Grove, and was able to serve
        in several capacities at my school. I was involved in student government, stage crew for school musicals, and volunteered my time at 
        my home church, the local Salvation Army, and other places. I also worked at Chick-Fil-A, so I might check all the boxes of stereotypical 
        Christian high school boy.

        So far my time here at Grove City has been fantastic and I have made so many friends at this school who I care so much about and can't wait 
        to spend more time with throughout college. The social community at this school is such a huge part of what makes it so amazing and has 
        made my time here awesome. I look forward to continuing to spend time with those I already know and cherish at this school and getting to know 
        those I have yet to meet!
