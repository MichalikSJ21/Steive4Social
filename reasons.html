    <h1>Reasons to Support</h1>
    <p>
        If I were you right now, I would be wondering why exactly I should vote for someone who put up some 
        funny meme posters and decided to code a webiste for his campaign. Well you came to the right spot!

    <p>
        -I have years of experience doing this sort of thing, seven of them to be exact. I served on my middle school
         and high school SGA equivalents for as long as I possibly could throughout my years, serving as the President of 
         both the Middle School and High School when I was in 8th and 12th grade respectively.

    <p>
        -I am detail-oriented and am able to work through planning events in a step by step way
    </p>

    <p>
        -I often see problems with situations before others do. I see myself as able to see and also solve problems very well. 
    </p>

    <p>
        -I pride myself on my excellent work in everything that I do. I often find myself guided by the principles stated in 1 Corinthians 10:31 
        which states, "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God". 
    </p>

    <p>
        -Speaking of faith, I am a firm believer in Christ as my Savior for my sins, and trust him to guide my actions throughout each individual day.
